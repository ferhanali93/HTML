<p align="justify">Growing up I always had a knack for numbers and accounts and I was organized and
    detail oriented to boot. It became apparent in my academic career early on, that I
    was cut out to specialize in what is known as the Accounting sector. I began my
    education in Accounting at La Guardia Community where I received my Associates
    in Applied Science in Accounting. My Accounting studies culminated at the well
    respected Business College of City University of New York, Queens College with my
    Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Accounting.</p>
<p align="justify">Seeing the business model end of the various professional experiences that I have,
    helped lay the foundation in what I would call my own personal level of skill set. I
    rose up through the ranks quickly during my time with my previous employer in the
    transportation industry. The owner and manager soon came to appreciate as I
    increased sales as well as streamlined operations to allow for a smoother workflow.</p>
<p align="justify">In my future professional career, I am currently working on expanding my career
        twofold. I am working diligently towards my main goal is in the Accounting field as
        to become a successful Certified Public Accountant. This would be the crowning
        jewel of all my Accounting education and experience that I have amassed. My work
        with the VITA/TCE Program affiliated with Queens College and York College,
        allowed me the experience to assist with the daily tasks of what a CPA would expect
        when it came to managing and assisting clients with the filing of their federal and
        local state taxes. My goal is to work my way up to a Senior Accountant position at a
        well-respected firm that I may be able to impart my skill set and knowledge to those
        I work with in the future. </p>
<p align="justify">On the other end of furthering my professional career, I would also like to expand
    my knowledge in other sectors as well. Therefore additionally to Accounting I am
    also pursuing certification as a Quality Assurance Automation Engineer. The
    information technology field has also been a great interest of mine, which I dedicate
    whatever time I do not spend towards furthering my career in Accounting, in
    expanding my knowledge base in IT industry.</p>
<p align="justify">In my free time, I have enjoyed playing the rigorous sport of cricket in a local league
    when I lived in the Bronx. The teamwork and camaraderie I participated in allowed
    me to fortify myself as a strong team player. My perseverance then led me to
    become the captain of my team, which I led to victory in many a local tournament. I
    also enjoy hiking a great deal as it allows me a time to connect with nature and revel
    in a natural peace that cannot be found anywhere else, but in the wilderness and on
    the weekends.</p>
<p align="justify">My closest friends and family know me to be a responsible and trustworthy person.
    I myself like being accountable for my actions, as I would not stand by them if I were
    not a man of my word. My past employers would also agree that I am a driven and
    ambitious person, as I was able to quickly learn the lay of the land so to speak. This
    allowed me to expand upon my position no matter where I began and lend my skill
    set in higher positions.</p>
